When building the machine, it is crucial to have the parts 3D printed precisely. Hence, print the parts in High Quality.
We have printed our machine with Ultimaker2, Makerbot Replicator 2, Makerbot Replicator 2x, and RepRapBcn+. Since reprap is not so preciase, some STL files are names as ...REP, which we have altered for that printer.

For laser cutting we have used 5mm and 6mm plexiglass. Use 6mm one for the gears, file gear-up.ai. For the rest use 5mm plexiglass. Important note, all plates are 600mm to 400mm, check you have select mm as unit. 

We are doing workshops to build one or more machines in one day, if you are interested hosting a workshop please let us know:
